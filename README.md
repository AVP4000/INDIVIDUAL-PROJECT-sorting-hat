## SORTING HAT [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bafb2cdf-317e-462e-87a9-be2185ca2ea5/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hpsortinghat-byap/deploys)

## OVERVIEW: 
The purpose of this application was to simulate the sorting hat from Harry Potter, where once the person enters their name or "puts on the hat", the application or "hat" will then assign a house to the user. 

## FEATURES:
- On a form, when a new student name is submitted, an newstudentobject is created and pushed into an array of students, which prints to the DOM. 
- When assigned, the card border color of the new student will match the new house assigned.
- The values for each house will be printed on the student card. 
- There is a button to expel students. When the button is clicked, that student object is pushed to a new array and a new card will print to the DOM under MOLDY VOLDYs ARMY

## POTENTIAL UPDATES
- Card Ordering: Sort the student cards by some criteria (i.e. alphabetically by name, by house)
- Redemption button: Create a button that sends the card either back to the previous student array with the same house or make an entirely new array for the redeemed student.
